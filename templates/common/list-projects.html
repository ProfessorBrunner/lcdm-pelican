{# 
This template fragment prints out the list of related projects for a
specific LCDM project. Note, this assumes the projects are files in a
directory with name matching the project slug metadata. In addition, the
page has Type: project

{# RJB: 12/31/2013

We loop through all pages on the site to find those with a category
equal to the current page slug. Since category is automatically derived
by Pelican from the directory structure (since we leave the variable
USE_FOLDER_AS_CATEGORY set to the default value of True. 

Note, an alternative approach is to use variables defined in each page.
This was my original approach, thus the presence of parent variables in
some files. In this case, the loop should be 

{% for mypage in pages if mypage.parent == page.slug  %}

Finally, the Save_as tage must be defined within any page that will be
included in a loop, or this approach will fail.

{# We loop over all pages to grab those that are in the right category #}

{% for mypage in pages|sort(attribute='date', reverse=True) 
    if mypage.parent == page.slug and mypage.type == 'subproject' %}

{# We need to initialize the HTML list #}

{% if loop.first %}
<hr />
    <h2> Relevant LCDM Projects </h2>
        <ul>
{% endif %}

{# Now we want to output summary information for each page #}
            <li><em><a href="{{ SITEURL }}/{{ mypage.save_as }}" rel="bookmark"
                    title="Permalink to {{ mypage.title|striptags }}">
                {{ mypage.title }}</a></em>: {{ mypage.summary }}
            </li>
            
{# Now close HTML list #}

{% if loop.last %}
