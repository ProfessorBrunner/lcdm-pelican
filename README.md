lcdm-pelican
============

This is a custom pelican theme originally developed for the Laboratory for Cosmological Data Mining at he University of Illinois. The theme has a clickable image header, a sidebar with static information and list of links, and a common footer.

Key points include:
- Heriarchical page sturcture.
- Output has multiple page directories (handles by using Save_as tag.
- Custom template for listing collection of pages by category
- Custom template for listing homepage that mixes static and dynamic content.

### Note: Ideally we could have multiple page directoires, but that requires a Pelican rewrite.
